# ImplicitIntent
In this project, I learned and made an application based on Implicit Intents. The application consists of 2 buttons namely as Open Result and Open Camera. When you'll  click on open result, it will take us to the browser and display the result url of our university. And when you click on the open camera, it will simply open the camera application.
